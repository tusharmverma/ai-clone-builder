# 🗺️ Roadmap

**What's coming next for fol-ai-match.**

## ✅ Week 1 (DONE)

**Goal:** Get basic AI clones talking locally

**What we built:**
- ✅ Personality questionnaire system
- ✅ AI clones that stay in character
- ✅ Clone-to-clone conversations
- ✅ Local setup with Ollama + LLaMA
- ✅ CLI interface for everything
- ✅ Conversation saving and history

**Result:** Two AI clones having natural 10+ message conversations!

## 🔄 Week 2-3: Better Memory

**Goal:** Smarter conversation context

**What we'll add:**
- FAISS vector memory for long-term context
- Better conversation summarization
- Improved personality consistency
- More conversation scenarios

**Why:** Right now clones only remember the last few messages. With FAISS, they'll remember important details from much longer conversations.

## 📱 Week 4-6: Real Data Import

**Goal:** Build clones from real chat data

**What we'll add:**
- WhatsApp chat import
- Discord conversation analysis
- Instagram/Twitter personality extraction
- Automatic personality refinement

**Why:** Instead of questionnaires, build clones from actual chat history for ultra-realistic personalities.

## 🤝 Month 2-3: Matchmaking Integration

**Goal:** Connect with external matching systems

**What we'll add:**
- API for external matchmaking agents
- Compatibility scoring between clones
- Advanced dating scenarios
- Personality matching insights

**Why:** Your friend's matchmaking system can use our clones to simulate conversations before real matches.

## 🌐 Month 4+: Platform & Polish

**Goal:** Make it accessible to everyone

**What we'll add:**
- Web interface (no more CLI)
- Cloud deployment options
- Voice conversations with clones
- Mobile app
- User dashboard and analytics

**Why:** Turn the MVP into a full platform that anyone can use easily.

## 🔮 Future Ideas

**Advanced Features:**
- Video avatars for clones
- Group conversations (3+ clones)
- Real-time clone learning
- Clone personality evolution
- Integration with VR/AR platforms

**Technical Improvements:**
- Better AI models (GPT-4, Claude)
- Faster response times
- Multi-language support
- Custom voice training

## 🎯 Success Metrics

**Week 2-3 Goals:**
- Clones remember 50+ message conversations
- Personality consistency over long chats
- 20+ built-in conversation scenarios

**Month 2 Goals:**
- Import WhatsApp chats in under 5 minutes
- 95%+ personality accuracy from chat data
- API for external integrations
