# Roadmap

**What's coming next for ai-clone-builder.**

## Week 1 (DONE)

**Goal:** Get basic AI clones talking locally

**What we built:**
- Personality questionnaire system
- AI clones that stay in character
- Clone-to-clone conversations
- Local setup with Ollama + LLaMA
- CLI interface for everything
- Conversation saving and history

**Result:** Two AI clones having natural 10+ message conversations!

## Week 2-3: Better Memory

**Goal:** Smarter conversation context

**What we'll add:**
- Enhanced SQLite vector memory for long-term context
- Better conversation summarization
- Improved personality consistency
- More conversation scenarios

**Why:** Right now clones only remember the last few messages. With enhanced vector memory, they'll remember important details from much longer conversations.

## Week 4-6: Real Data Import

**Goal:** Build clones from real chat data

**What we'll add:**
- WhatsApp chat import
- Discord conversation analysis
- Instagram/Twitter personality extraction
- Automatic personality refinement

**Why:** Instead of questionnaires, build clones from actual chat history for ultra-realistic personalities.

## Month 2-3: Matchmaking Integration

**Goal:** Connect with external matching systems

**What we'll add:**
- API for external matchmaking agents
- Compatibility scoring between clones
- Advanced dating scenarios
- Personality matching insights

**Why:** Your friend's matchmaking system can use our clones to simulate conversations before real matches.

## Month 4+: Platform & Polish

**Goal:** Make it accessible to everyone

**What we'll add:**
- Web interface (no more CLI)
- Cloud deployment options
- Voice conversations with clones
- Mobile app
- User dashboard and analytics

**Why:** Turn the MVP into a full platform that anyone can use easily.

## Future Ideas

**Advanced Features:**
- Video avatars for clones
- Group conversations (3+ clones)
- Real-time clone learning
- Clone personality evolution
- Integration with VR/AR platforms

**Technical Improvements:**
- Better AI models (GPT-4, Claude)
- Faster response times
- Multi-language support
- Custom voice training

## Success Metrics

**Week 2-3 Goals:**
- Clones remember 50+ message conversations
- Personality consistency over long chats
- 20+ built-in conversation scenarios

**Month 2 Goals:**
- Import WhatsApp chats in under 5 minutes
- 95%+ personality accuracy from chat data
- API for external integrations

**Month 4 Goals:**
- Web interface with 1000+ users
- Voice conversations feeling natural
- Mobile app in app stores

## Open Questions

**Technical:**
- Which vector database performs best for our use case?
- How to handle very large chat histories efficiently?
- Best approach for voice synthesis that matches personality?

**Product:**
- What conversation scenarios are most important?
- How to balance privacy with cloud features?
