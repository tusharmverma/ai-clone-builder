python -m src.interface.cli
# Choose option 4: "Chat with Clone"
```

**Sample conversation:**
```
You: What do you like to do on weekends?

Jordan: Ha! Weekends are my sacred time. I'm usually either 
hiking some new trail upstate or experimenting with a ridiculous 
recipe I found on Instagram. Last weekend I tried making Korean 
corn dogs... let's just say my kitchen looked like a crime scene. 
What about you - any fun weekend plans?

You: I love hiking too! Any favorite spots?

Jordan: Oh nice, a fellow trail enthusiast! Bear Mountain is my 
go-to when I want something challenging but not too far from the 
city. The view from the top is absolutely worth the leg pain. 
Have you done any of the trails up there?
```

Notice how Jordan:
- Stays in character (witty, expressive)
- References their interests (hiking, cooking)
- Asks follow-up questions
- Remembers the conversation context

Margaret Atwood? I've been dying to read it but haven't found the time.

üí≠ Jamie: Oh hey! Yeah, it's incredible so far. Atwood has this way 
of making dystopia feel uncomfortably possible, you know? Are you a 
big reader? I'm always looking for recommendations.

üó£Ô∏è Maya: Totally! I'm more of a sci-fi nerd myself, but I love anything 
that makes you think. Have you read any Kim Stanley Robinson? His Mars 
trilogy is mind-blowing...
```

## Example 5: Create Multiple Personalities

**What it does:** Build different AI clones and compare them  
**Time:** 10-15 minutes

- Thoughtful responses  
- Enjoys reading, puzzles
- Values deep conversations

**Clone 2 - "The Extrovert"**
- Very expressive
- Energetic responses
- Loves parties, sports
- Values social connections

**Watch them interact:** The introvert will be thoughtful and measured, while the extrovert will be enthusiastic and social.

## Example 6: Test Personality Consistency

**What it does:** See if your AI clone stays in character  
**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Easy

**Good clones will:**
