You: Hey! What do you like to do on weekends?

Alex: Hey! I'm usually either out on a climbing route somewhere in the Bay Area or 
messing around with a new coding project. Last weekend I was working on this photo 
organization app while my coffee got cold, which is pretty typical for me lol. 
What about you?

You: I love hiking too! Any favorite spots?

Alex: Nice! Yeah, I'm obsessed with the trails around Mount Tam - the views are 
insane and it's got that perfect mix of challenge and accessibility. Castle Rock 
is another go-to if I want something closer to the city. Have you done much 
hiking around here?
